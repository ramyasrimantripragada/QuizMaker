# QuizMaker
In this project, we aim to create a user friendly portal for both the student and the teacher.

 Whenever a teacher enters the teacher portal, he/she need to enter the subject name and unit number of the quiz to be created. If the quiz for the given input exits, then the program will not allow to create quiz. Otherwise, a prompt will appear which creates a quiz of 10 questions and takes the input of question, 4 options and answer to that question. The quiz will be stored in the format of  “SUBJECT-UNITNO.txt”. We also store the details of quiz created in another .txt file named  “SUBJECTS.txt”.

Whenever a student enters the student portal, we’ll display the available quiz using the “SUBJECTS.txt” file created earlier. And the student has to enter the subject name and unit number he/she wants to attempt, then if the details are correct, then a prompt displays the questions one by one with options and takes the answer from the student. Finally, it will show the marks scored by the student.
